## Search Select

Navigate and view search results quickly with shortcuts.

Search Select provides a way to use your keyboard to view and open search results. Using your keyboard is a much faster and more efficient way to work as you don’t have to lift your hands from the keyboard every time you search.

* S - Select next result
* W - Select previous result
* Q - Move to the top
* Enter - Open selected result
* Ctrl/Cmd + Enter - Open the selected result in a new tab

 You can customize the shortcut keys by heading to the extension’s settings page if you prefer your own key bindings.
